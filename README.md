# TriviaGame

* Trivia Game is a project meant to test the knowledge of the coder in the form of a broswer based multiple choice game.

* The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. The game ends when the time runs out. 

* The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly. Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question. Don't forget to include a countdown timer.

* I started with making a simple timer that can count down from 0. I used the setInterval method to call a function i made based on if/else statements.

* Then I made the time activate on the click of a button with the .on method.

* I made a template for questions in arrays.

* Found out about .hide() and .show(). These will be good for figuring out how to make "different pages."

* found out about radio objects
